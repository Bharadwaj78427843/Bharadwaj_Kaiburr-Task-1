Kaiburr Assessment - Task 5: Data Science Example (Text Classification)
This repository contains a Python script (text_classification.py) that performs multi-class text classification on the Consumer Complaint Database.

Steps Required by the Assessment
1.Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering: Data filtering, cleaning, and TF-IDF Vectorization.

2.Text Pre-Processing: Cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and Lemmatization.

3.Selection of Multi Classification model: Logistic Regression is used.

4.Comparison of model performance: Metrics are compared via the Classification Report.

5.Model Evaluation: Accuracy and detailed metrics are reported.

6.Prediction: Sample prediction function is demonstrated.

Execution
1.Download Data: Download the Consumer Complaint Database CSV and save it as consumer_complaints.csv in this directory.

2.Install Prerequisites: pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk.

3.Run the script: python text_classification.py.

4.Verification (for Screenshot Capture):
